The Strategies: Source Protection and Digital Security
======================================================

### Preface: Beware the Buzzwords

Since the Snowden revelations of 2013, a seemingly endless supply of app
developers and service providers has emerged onto the online landscape
promising “private,” “anonymous,” and/or “secure” communications.
Despite the recent SnapChat settlement,<sup>[41](footnotes/README.html#fn41)</sup> however, companies’
use of these terms is unregulated and the terms themselves are generally
poorly defined.<sup>[42](footnotes/README.html#fn42)</sup> Yet in order to meaningfully protect our
digital communications, clarifying the nuances of these terms is
essential. We began that process in an earlier section, where we exposed
the legal concept of privacy to be importantly limited to, among other
things, information that has not been shared in any way with a third
party.

“Anonymity,” meanwhile, is a word that is often used as a catchall to
describe communications that may, in reality, be anonymous,
pseudonymous, or simply unpublished. In journalism, citing “anonymous”
sources is usually “a last resort”[[The Disconnect on Anonymous
Sources](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/opinion/sunday/the-public-editor-the-disconnect-on-anonymous-sources.html?_r=0),
Margaret Sullivan. *The New York Times*, 10/12/13, but such sources are
typically anything but: Their physical and/or legal identities are
likely well-known to the reporters and editors with whom they work.
“Pseudonymity,” meanwhile, describes any handle other than our direct
physical or legal identity. In this sense, all digital communications
are technically pseudonymous, whether or not we generally think of them
as such. Pseudonyms may be persistent or one-time use; an email address
of your legal name is a pseudonym as much as a throwaway Reddit account.
As we will see, however, the most important characteristic of an
effective pseudonym, for journalists and sources, is whether or not it
is *linkable* to its user’s physical or legal identity.

The concept of *linkability* is crucial precisely because, as discussed
above, it is what undermines the practical value of most current shield
protections for journalists. Though the concept of source protection is
often thought of as not “naming” your source, the reality is that the
defaults on most email, chat, text, and telephone systems do exactly
that with every exchange through the digital traces these activities
leave behind. The metadata records stored by service providers can so
efficiently link journalists to their sources that the authorities need
rarely make the effort to take journalists to court.

This means that where protecting the identity of a source is truly
necessary, it is essential that these communications be *unlinkable*.

As we will see below, effective use of pseudonyms is an essential
component of achieving *unlinkability*. Yet pseudonyms themselves
present something of a conundrum: How can we know who really “owns” a
particular digital identity? This fundamental issue is one of the
reasons that so many of us have rushed to “claim” the email addresses
comprised of our legal names on major service providers, and why many
organizations follow a simple pattern when generating email addresses as
well. These practices recognize the problems of *authentication* and
*verification* - determining who “owns” an email address or telephone
number. While we often assume that an email address made up of someone’s
legal name belongs to them, in reality we also take steps to verify
digital contact information, though often without thinking about it:
Someone gives us their email address at an event, and we continue the
in-person conversation digitally; we call a phone number we’ve been
given and the voice that answers sounds like our friend or colleague; we
arrange to meet someone via chat and the person we expect shows up at
the right place and time. In each case, we use some kind of non-digital
communication to verify that the person using the email address,
telephone number or chat handle is the same person who provided it to
us. In the digital world, this is often described as “out of channel” or
“out of band” verification, and it’s an important aspect of using all
digital pseudonyms, including the “public keys” that we will discuss
below. The complement to this process, meanwhile, is *authentication,*
where someone proves to us–through their physical self or voice–that
they are who they claim to be. If authenticating a person’s identity
ourselves isn’t possible, then we have to rely on the word of someone we
trust.

Of course, the easiest part of protecting our information–whether it’s
footage, photographs, notes or a source list–is through a strong
password practice. As we’ll see in more detail below, the simplest way
to do this is simply to stop thinking pass*word* and start thinking
pass*phrase*. This makes for logins that are both easier to remember and
harder to crack.
